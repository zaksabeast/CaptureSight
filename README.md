# CaptureSight

CaptureSight is a Nintendo Switch homebrew to view Pokemon Sword and Shield data while playing Sword and Shield. CaptureSight comes as both an overlay and an applet.

### Features:

- View Pokemon species, attacks, IVs, type matches, etc. for
  - Wild Pokemon
  - In-Trade Pokemon
  - Raid Pokemon
  - Party Pokemon
  - Box Pokemon
- View all active dens
  - Current seed for Raid RNG
  - The number of advances until a Shiny Pokemon
  - Species of a den
  - Shiny type of a den (star or square)
  - Stars of a den
- Find the raid seed that created a Pokemon
  - Join a trade or raid with a person who doesn't have custom firmware and use CaptureSight to get their raid seed
- Since CaptureSight can show the next shiny frame, upcoming IVs, and seed that created a Pokemon, no external tools are needed for Raid RNG
  - With raid and trade views, anyone without custom firmware only needs to know someone with custom firmware to do Raid RNG
- The Applet has translations for multiple langues based on the Switch language setting
  - English
  - French
  - Italian
  - Spanish
  - Chinese
  - Partial support for:
    - German

## Building

DevkitPro and libnx will be needed to build this tool.

After installing those, run `make`.

Optional: To build the raid event flatbuffer header, install [flatc](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_using_schema_compiler.html) and run `flatc --cpp -o libcsight/include/csight/ libcsight/resources/NestHoleDistributionEncounter8Archive.fbs`. Alternatively, use a docker image with `flatc`, such as [neomantra/flatbuffers](https://hub.docker.com/r/neomantra/flatbuffers).
